<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated Software Test Engineer at Jack Henry, where I specialize in ensuring the quality and reliability of our software products. My journey in web development began during my college years, where I took several courses that laid a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, I have been refreshing and expanding these skills as part of our Project Horizon group, which is now focusing on Full Stack Development. This initiative has allowed me to dive deeper into both front-end and back-end technologies, enhancing my versatility as a developer.</p>

<p>With over a decade of experience in the IT industry, I have been involved in both development and testing since 2013. My professional background includes extensive work in retail banking, where I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of banking applications. This experience has been instrumental in my ability to conduct thorough end-to-end testing, ensuring that our applications meet the highest standards of functionality and security.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional life, I am a proud father of two wonderful children. Balancing my career and family life has taught me the importance of time management and prioritization. In addition to my role as a parent, I am also a passionate touring musician. Music has always been a significant part of my life, providing a creative outlet and a way to connect with others. When I am not working or performing, you can often find me exploring the great outdoors. Whether it's hiking, camping, or simply enjoying nature, I find that spending time outside helps me recharge and stay inspired.</p>
